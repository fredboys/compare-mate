# Site Goals

Compare mate was built to build a community of shoppers and help everyone find great deals on products they love. The site allows users to easily navigate and search for potential products they are interested in. Site comes with a range of features from commenting to favouriting products.

# Agile Methodology

By using AGILE methodology in this project I was able to deliver a site which had all required functionality and was able to give even more extra detail when going through the project. It had been done by delivering small features in incremental sprints. This was done with a tight deadline only being less then a month away.

## User Stories 

As a user: 

* I can view a navbar from every page so that I can navigate easily between pages
* I can navigate through pages quickly so that I can view content seamlessly without page refresh
* I can create a new account so that I can access all the features for signed up users
* I can sign in to the app so that I can access functionality for logged in users
* I can tell if I am logged in or not so that I can log in if I need to
* I can maintain my logged-in status until I choose to log out so that my user experience is not compromised
* When logged out I can see sign in and sign up options so that I can sign in/sign up
* When logged in I can create posts so that I can share my product deals
* I can view the details of a single product post so that I can learn more about it
* When logged in I can Up Vote a product so that I can show my support for the product posts that interest me
* When logged in I can favourite a product so that I save it for later if I want to come back
* I can view all the most recent product posts, ordered by most recently created first so that I am up to date with the newest content
* I can search for products by category, so that I can find the products I am most interested in.
* I can search for products by keyword, so that I can find the products I am most interested in.
* I can keep scrolling through the images on the site, that are loaded for me automatically so that I don't have to click on "next page"
* When logged in I can add comments to a post so that I can share my thoughts about the post
* When logged in I can view comments to a post so that I can see others thoughts about the post
* When I'm a post owner I can edit my product name, description, price, location, link, category so that I can make corrections or update my post after it was created
* When I'm a owner of a post I can delete my post so that I can control removal of my post from the application
* When I'm a owner of a comment I can delete my comment so that I can control removal of my comment from the application
* I can see a list of the trending products so that I can see which products are popular
* I can view statistics about my profile: number of posts, number of votes received and number of favourites received
* When logged in I can edit my profile so that I can change my profile picture and bio
* When logged in I can update my username and password so that I can change my display name and keep my profile secure
* I can contact the site admin so that I can report any problems are bugs I find

## Project Board

Githubs projects was used to track user stories and implement ideas based on their level of importance for allowing use of the app with no loss of functionality or user experience. Two labels were created indicating their level of importance, those were:

* Must Have 
* Should Have

I used GitHub projects board to create the user stories and keep track of my tasks. Here is the link to my board - [Project Board Link](https://github.com/users/fredboys/projects/12/views/1)

Here is also a screenshot overview

## Wireframes

I built these wireframes with balsamiq to help me get a design ready for the website. The final website may look different form the inital wireframes.
